Python is a `high-level`, versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it a favorite among beginners and professionals alike. Created by `Guido van Rossum` and first released in `1991`, Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including `procedural`, `object-oriented`, and `functional` programming. Its extensive standard library and active community provide tools for diverse applications, from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing. Pythonâ€™s concise syntax enables developers to write code efficiently, enhancing productivity while maintaining clarity. As a result, it has become a cornerstone in modern software development, data science, and machine learning.
